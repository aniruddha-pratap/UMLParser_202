Introduction

In this project, we have implemented a UML parser which parses the java code to identify attributed and methods of the class and the relationships between classes and generate a class diagram from the source code.
Tools and Libraries

We have used the below libraries/tools to build the project:

• javaparser-core (https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser): This library parses the java source code to generate the Abstract Syntax Tree from the java code. We then use this AST to analyze the code and identify the attributes, methods and relationship between classes.

• yUML (https://yuml.me/): yUML is a tool using which we can be used to generate UML diagrams. We use the AST generated by the java parser and modify it to generate the grammar as per the format of the yUML which can be used to generate the class diagrams.

Steps to run

Please find below he steps to run the project.

1. Run the below command to generate uml diagram

java -jar UMLParser@202.jar TestUMLParser\Test1 aniruddheTestCase1

where 
UMLParser@202.jar is the name of the jar file. 
“TestUMLParser\Test1” is the folder name for the files for test case 
“aniruddhTestCase1” is the name of the output image which is generated in the same folder as input file folder .
